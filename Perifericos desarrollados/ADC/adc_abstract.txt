The ADC project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' evaluation board, and 
demonstrating interrupt mode and polling mode for ADC. The 
result of conversion can be stored in variable of ADC0Value, 
and can be displayed in Watch& Call Stack Window.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
