The ADC project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' evaluation board,
demonstrating a ADC burst transfer using the DMA. 

The result of conversion can be stored in variable of ADCValue[] 
which can be displayed in Watch & Call Stack Window and is displayed
onto the UART0 (9600)

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
