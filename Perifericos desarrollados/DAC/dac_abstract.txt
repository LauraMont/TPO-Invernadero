The DAC project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller. The result of conversion can be probed 
at Pin AOUT. Or if a LED and a 1k ohm resistor connect
in series between AOUT and GND, we can see the LED flashes quickly.

To run the DAC project using the DMA: set "DAC_DMA_ENABLED" to 1

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
