The RIT TIMER project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' evaluation board, and 
demonstrating timer functionality.

This project simply repeatedly toggle LEDs connected to P2.2-6

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
