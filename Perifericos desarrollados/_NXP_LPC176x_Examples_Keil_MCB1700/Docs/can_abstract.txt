The CAN project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller.
Send one message from CAN1(TX) and verify received message 
on CAN2(RX) if it's a match, both CAN TX and RX are working.

This sample project requires an external RS-232 (F-F) cable
to connect CAN1 with CAN2.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
