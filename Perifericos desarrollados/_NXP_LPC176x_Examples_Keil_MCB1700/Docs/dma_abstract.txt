The DMA project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller. The DMA resultcan be verified  by setting
two breakpoints at the two dead loops at the end of the main
function.


Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
