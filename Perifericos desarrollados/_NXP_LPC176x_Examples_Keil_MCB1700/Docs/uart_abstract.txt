The UART project is a simple program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' evaluation board.
Send some characters from the Serial Terminal, LPC1768 will
send back the same characters to Serial Terminal immediately.


Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
