/* 
From device to device, the I2C communication protocol may vary, 
in the example below, the protocol uses repeated start to read data from or 
write to the device:
For master read: the sequence is: STA,Addr(W),offset,RE-STA,Addr(r),data...STO 
for master write: the sequence is: STA,Addr(W),offset,RE-STA,Addr(w),data...STO
Thus, in state 8, the address is always WRITE. in state 10, the address could 
be READ or WRITE depending on the I2C command.
